# Security Policy

## Overview

The security and privacy of Form2SDCTemplate users is a top priority. This document outlines our security policies, how to report vulnerabilities, and what to expect from the security process.

---

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 4.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 4.0   | :x:                |

Only the current major version (4.x.x) aligned with SDC Generation 4 receives security updates.

## Security Considerations

### Project Scope

Form2SDCTemplate is a documentation and template project designed for use with Large Language Models (LLMs). It has unique security characteristics:

**What This Project Is:**
- Markdown documentation for LLM-assisted template generation
- No runtime code execution
- No network communication
- No data storage or transmission

**What This Project Is Not:**
- Not a web service or API
- Not a data processing application
- Not handling sensitive personal or healthcare data directly

### Potential Security Concerns

Despite its documentation-only nature, security considerations exist:

1. **Generated Template Security**
   - Templates generated by LLMs could contain malicious XML constructs
   - Users should validate all generated templates before deployment
   - Never execute or deploy templates without review

2. **LLM Interaction Risks**
   - Uploading sensitive form descriptions to third-party LLMs
   - Potential data exposure through LLM conversations
   - LLM output reliability and consistency

3. **Downstream Usage**
   - Templates are used in healthcare and research contexts
   - Generated templates must comply with data protection regulations
   - Validation is critical before production use

---

## Best Practices for Users

### When Using Form2SDCTemplate

1. **Review Generated Output**
   - Always review LLM-generated templates before use
   - Validate templates using [sdcvalidator](https://github.com/SemanticDataCharter/sdcvalidator)
   - Test templates in non-production environments first

2. **Protect Sensitive Information**
   - Avoid including personal or sensitive data in form descriptions
   - Use generic examples instead of real patient/participant data
   - Be aware of LLM provider data retention policies

3. **Validate Before Deployment**
   - Run generated XML through schema validators
   - Check for unexpected elements or attributes
   - Verify semantic annotations are correct
   - Test with sample data before production use

4. **Compliance Considerations**
   - Ensure generated templates meet regulatory requirements (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.)
   - Document template generation process for audit trails
   - Maintain version control of generated templates

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### When to Report

Please report security vulnerabilities if you discover:

- Malicious content in documentation or templates
- Instructions that could lead to insecure template generation
- Vulnerabilities in related SDC4 ecosystem tools
- Privacy concerns with recommended LLM usage
- Any security issue that could affect users

### How to Report

**Do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities via email:

**Email:** security@axius-sdc.com

**Subject Line:** [SECURITY] Form2SDCTemplate - Brief Description

### What to Include

Please include the following information:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: Potential security impact and affected components
3. **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
4. **Environment**: Relevant environment details (LLM provider, version, etc.)
5. **Suggested Fix**: If you have a proposed solution (optional)
6. **Disclosure**: Your preferred disclosure timeline (if any)

### Example Report

```
Subject: [SECURITY] Form2SDCTemplate - Potential XSS in Generated Templates

Description:
When using the template with [LLM Provider], certain input patterns
cause generation of XML with embedded script tags.

Impact:
Generated templates could contain executable code if processed by
XML parsers without proper sanitization.

Reproduction:
1. Upload template to [LLM Provider]
2. Input form description: [example]
3. Generated output contains: <script>...</script>

Environment:
- Form2SDCTemplate version: 4.0.0
- LLM Provider: [name]
- Date tested: [date]

Suggested Fix:
Add explicit instruction to LLM template to escape special characters.
```

### Timeline

1. **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours of report
2. **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
3. **Status Update**: Every 7 days until resolved
4. **Resolution**: Varies by severity and complexity

### Severity Levels

- **Critical**: Immediate data exposure or compromise (24-48 hour resolution target)
- **High**: Significant security risk (1 week resolution target)
- **Medium**: Moderate security concern (2-4 weeks resolution target)
- **Low**: Minor issue with workarounds (addressed in next release)

### Communication

---

## Disclosure Policy

### Coordinated Disclosure

We follow coordinated disclosure practices:

1. **Private Resolution**: Work privately to understand and fix the issue
2. **Patch Development**: Create and test a fix
3. **User Notification**: Alert users of affected versions
4. **Public Disclosure**: Publish security advisory after patch is available

### Disclosure Timeline

- **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
- **Day 1-2**: Acknowledgment sent
- **Day 3-7**: Assessment and patch development
- **Day 7-30**: Testing and validation
- **Day 30-90**: Public disclosure (varies by severity)

We may adjust timelines based on:
- Severity and exploitability
- Complexity of the fix
- Coordination with other projects
- Your input as the reporter

### User Privacy Responsibilities

When using this tool:
- Review LLM provider privacy policies
- Avoid uploading sensitive data to LLM services
- Understand data retention practices of chosen LLM
- Consider on-premises LLM solutions for sensitive use cases

---

## Compliance

### Standards Alignment

Form2SDCTemplate supports generation of templates compliant with:

- W3C XML Schema (XSD)
- ISO 11179 (Metadata Registries)
- ISO 20022 (Data Components)
- HL7 Standards (Healthcare data)

### Regulatory Considerations

Users must ensure:
- Generated templates meet applicable regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.)
- Validation processes are documented
- Data governance policies are followed
